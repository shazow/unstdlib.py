class open_atomic(object):
    """
    Opens a file for atomic writing by writing to a temporary file, then moving
    the temporary file into place once writing has finished.

    When ``close()`` is called, the temporary file is moved into place,
    overwriting any file which may already exist (except on Windows, see note
    below). If moving the temporary file fails, ``abort()`` will be called *and
    an exception will be raised*.

    If ``abort()`` is called the temporary file will be removed and the
    ``aborted`` attribute will be set to ``True``. No exception will be raised
    if an error is encountered while removing the temporary file; instead, the
    ``abort_error`` attribute will be set to the exception raised by
    ``os.remove`` (note: on Windows, if ``file.close()`` raises an exception,
    ``abort_error`` will be set to that exception; see implementation of
    ``abort()`` for details).

    By default, ``open_atomic`` will put the temporary file in the same
    directory as the target file:
    ``${dirname(target_file)}/.${basename(target_file)}.temp``. See also the
    ``prefix``, ``suffix``, and ``dir`` arguments to ``open_atomic()``. When
    changing these options, remember:

        * The source and the destination must be on the same filesystem,
          otherwise the call to ``os.replace()``/``os.rename()`` may fail (and
          it *will* be much slower than necessary).
        * Using a random temporary name is likely a poor idea, as random names
          will mean it's more likely that temporary files will be left
          abandoned if a process is killed and re-started.
        * The temporary file will be blindly overwritten.

    The ``temp_name`` and ``target_name`` attributes store the temporary
    and target file names, and the ``name`` attribute stores the "current"
    name: if the file is still being written it will store the ``temp_name``,
    and if the temporary file has been moved into place it will store the
    ``target_name``.

    .. note::

        ``open_atomic`` will not work correctly on Windows with Python 2.X or
        Python <= 3.2: the call to ``open_atomic.close()`` will fail when the
        destination file exists (since ``os.rename`` will not overwrite the
        destination file; an exception will be raised and ``abort()`` will be
        called). On Python 3.3 and up ``os.replace`` will be used, which
        will be safe and atomic on both Windows and Unix.

    Example::

        >>> _doctest_setup()
        >>> f = open_atomic("/tmp/open_atomic-example.txt")
        >>> f.temp_name
        '/tmp/.open_atomic-example.txt.temp'
        >>> f.write("Hello, world!") and None
        >>> (os.path.exists(f.target_name), os.path.exists(f.temp_name))
        (False, True)
        >>> f.close()
        >>> os.path.exists("/tmp/open_atomic-example.txt")
        True

    By default, ``open_atomic`` uses the ``open`` builtin, but this behaviour
    can be changed using the ``opener`` argument::

        >>> import io
        >>> f = open_atomic("/tmp/open_atomic-example.txt",
        ...                opener=io.open,
        ...                mode="w+",
        ...                encoding="utf-8")
        >>> some_text = u"\u1234"
        >>> f.write(some_text) and None
        >>> f.seek(0)
        0
        >>> f.read() == some_text
        True
        >>> f.close()
